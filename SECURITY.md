# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At **Prismio**, we take security very seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities in our project, we encourage you to responsibly disclose them.

### How to Report

1. **Do not open a public issue** if you have found a security-related issue. We prefer you to report it confidentially to avoid disclosing the vulnerability before we have a chance to fix it.
2. Email your findings to **[vibrant.official275@gmail.com](mailto:vibrant.official275@gmail.com)** with the following information:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any relevant proof of concept (code, screenshots, etc.).
   - Your contact details for any follow-up questions.

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge the receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
- We will investigate and respond to your report within **7 days** with either a plan to address the issue or an explanation of why it is not considered a vulnerability.
- Once the issue is verified, we will work on a fix and coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline with you.

### Supported Versions

We ensure security updates for the following versions of **Prismio**:

- **Latest version**: Always fully supported.
- **Previous major version**: Supported for critical vulnerabilities.

If you are using an older version, we recommend upgrading to the latest release to ensure security and stability.

### Thank You
