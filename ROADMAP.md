# Prismio Roadmap

## Overview
The Prismio project aims to develop a high-performance, cross-platform programming language with a modern syntax and seamless interoperability with C++. The project will leverage LLVM for advanced compilation and optimization.

## Current Status
- **Lexer:** Completed
- **Parser:** Ongoing

## Upcoming Milestones

### 1. Parser Completion
- Finalize the parser implementation and conduct comprehensive testing to ensure accurate syntax analysis.

### 2. Semantic Analysis
- Implement semantic analysis to validate the structure and meaning of the parsed code, ensuring adherence to language rules.

### 3. Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation
- Develop a mechanism for generating an intermediate representation of the code that can be optimized and translated to machine code using LLVM.

### 4. Code Generation
- Implement code generation to produce executable binaries from the intermediate representation.

### 5. Runtime Development
- Develop the runtime environment for Prismio, focusing on memory management, error handling, and concurrency features.

### 6. Standard Library
- Create a standard library with essential data structures and functions to facilitate development in Prismio.

### 7. Documentation and Tutorials
- Develop comprehensive documentation and tutorials to help new users get started with Prismio.

### 8. Community Building
- Focus on building a community around Prismio through forums, social media, and events to encourage collaboration and contributions.

## Conclusion
The Prismio project is committed to delivering a powerful and flexible programming language that meets the needs of developers. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community as we progress through our roadmap.
